cart is stored in session database
express session 

It install because we cannot see a secret file 
npm install dotenv

express flash is downloaded
connect-mongo
we use MongoDbStore as M is capital then it is class or constructor function then we use new keyword 
now client side code in resources file in js
data attribute -data-anyname="pizza" any name we select from function name as pizza
object convert into string then use JSON.stringify(pizza) in home ejs
axios is added for ajax libraries
noty library added for displaying cart is successful
Build register crud
In expressjs data is received by default expressjs don't know what type of data is like json data,urlencoded data so explicity tell expressjs 
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false})) is used to authenticate
we use seesion for check error so we have used libaray express-flash flash message is to stored single request
we couldn't create a password as open to store in database so we have to used hash password 
so we have to used libraries npm install bcrypt
passportjs node package manager for login authenticate we used

//error
Login sessions require session support. Did you forget to use `express-session` middleware?
and in logout page we got error that req#logout requires a callback function so after trying we found answer then resolved it
//

if login then do not show login or register page i have to show only logout page

 it found in ejs through we use server.js file in middleware
 app.use((req,res,next)=>{
     res.locals.session=req.session
     next()
})
 session.cart ? session.cart.totalQty
 so if we add user in ejs then we use miidleware is res.locals/user=req.user
